# squish ![](https://nukocities.neocities.org/nuko/sets/cat325.gif)

squish is a lightweight shell made in Racket which at the moment is still in beta!

### Installation

For now squish is a standalone executable (it will later be available in some package managers!), so you can clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkukiro/squish
cd squish
sudo install squish /usr/bin
```

### Usage
> **Note**
> There is currently no way to `cd` in squish yet

To run squish, make sure you have `rlwrap` installed, and after that, you can run squish anywhere by simply typing running `squish`
