# squish ![](https://nukocities.neocities.org/nuko/sets/cat325.gif)

squish is a lightweight shell made in Racket which at the moment is still in beta!

### Installation

For now squish is a standalone executable (it will later be available in some package managers!), so you can clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkukiro/squish
```

### Usage

To run the executable, make sure you have `rlwrap` installed, and after that, you can run squish by simply typing this:

```bash
rlwrap -n ./squish
```

<sub>About exiting squish, at the moment the only way is pressing `Ctrl + C`<sub>
